                    New World, a game hyped by many in 2021, only to have a terrible launch plagued by bugs, dupe exploits, over populated servers and the game simply just lacking content.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But where is it now?
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Maybe you're like me and considering going back to the grind after a long break or just interested to see how the game is developing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Read on for all updates & improvements the game has had since release, and what's upcoming.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Updates will be in release order, not including bug fixes.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2><span>Update 1: Server Transfers</span></h2>
                <img src="/images/new-world-whats-been-added/picture-2.jpg" alt="New world Server Transfers">
               <p>Packed full of bug fixes and additional servers to reduce the painful queue times at launch, the main addition was the ability to server transfer your character to join your friends as well as just looking for a fresh start.</p>
               
               <br>
                <h2><span>Update 2: Into the Void</span></h2>
                <img src="/images/new-world-whats-been-added/picture-3.jpg" alt="New world Server Into the Void">
               <p>A large update bringing in a new weapon to the game, <span>The Void Gauntlet</span> which is classed as a hybrid weapon due to it being high DPS/support. The update has also added a new enemy type the Varangian Knight's, which gives off a real Dark Souls type vibe.</p>
               <p>Other notable changes are faster movement speed on roads 10% to be exact, and now trading posts are linked together so you don't need to travel to each one to find the best price.</p>
               
               <br>
               <h2><span>Update 3: Expedition Mutators</span></h2>
               <img src="/images/new-world-whats-been-added/picture-4.jpg" alt="New World Expedition Mutators">
               <p>The first end-game content update, adding expedition mutators, one of those high risk, high reward moments. Mutators really can make you think about what strategy you take on expeditions as they can really effect your style of play.</p>
               <p>Update has also added Umbral Shards to the game, a very powerful resourse which can take an item with 600 power all the way to 625, raising your equipments gear score as a whole.</p>
               
                <br>
                <h2><span>Update 4: Hearts Of Madness</span></h2>
                <img src="/images/new-world-whats-been-added/picture-5.jpg" alt="New World Hearts Of Madness">
                <p>A large update focusing on the story finale, it brings a new expedition with what would be the final boss "Isabella", recommended level 60 with with a decent gear score before challenging this one.</p>
                <p>A new weapon has also been added the <span>Blunderbuss</span> a personal favourite of mine, it packs one hell of a punch with its two round shotgun barrel, with it being a close range weapon it has abilities to close the gap such as a grapple to drag enemies to you, very effective for PVP aswell.</p>

                <br>
                <h2><span>Update 5: Arenas</span></h2>
                <img src="/images/new-world-whats-been-added/picture-6.jpg" alt="New World Arenas">
                <p>This update is packed full of goodies, the main addition being the new 3v3 arenas a small scale PVP game mode, consists of 5 rounds on a "Best-to-3-basis", available at level 20 but i would recommend waiting untul your familiar with PVP and don't have outdated equipment to your level.</p>
                <p>Other content added, more expedition mutators to add more vaariety and challanges for expeditions, Varangian Knight's quest line plus 3 more unit type's, and a PVP rewards tracker, whether it's arena's or just general PVP you are now rewarded for your faction participation, rewards such as emotes, cosmetics and gear.</p>

                <br>
                <h2><span>Update 6: Musical Instruments</span></h2>
                <img src="/images/new-world-whats-been-added/picture-7.jpg" alt="New World Instruments">
                <p>By far my favourite update so far, adding musical instruments to start a band or play solo who doesn't want to be a bard amidst a battle, if you've ever played Rock Band or Guitar Hero the button system is very similar and credit where it's due the songs are actually really captivating. They offer buffs such as gathering speed to luck gain. It's treated as a general life skill that you can upgrade by just playing and you can find song pages scattered around the world to learn new songs.</p>
                <h3><span>Instruments Added:</span></h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Guitar</li>
                <li>Mandolin</li>
                <li>Upright Bass</li>
                <li>Drums</li>
                <li>Azoth Flute</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h2><span>Update 7: Revamped Starting Experience (Coming Soon)</span></h2>
                <img src="/images/new-world-whats-been-added/picture-8.jpg" alt="New World Greatsword">
                <p>Another large update scheduled to release October 2022, focusing on new players starting experience, with new story, quests and new characters to make the beginning grind more fun to keep players engaged.</p>
                <p>A new weapon is also being added the <span>Two Handed Greatsword</span>, what i've seen so far is it utilizes a strength and defensive stance which can be toggled depending on your style of play.</p>

                <br>
                <h2><span>Summary</span></h2>
                <br>
                <p>The New World team have been hard at work since the game released in 2021, trying to redeem themself's for a troubled launch, with thousands of bug fixes and balance changes, i'm interested to see what's next as they don't look to be slowing down. </p>
                <P>Would i recommend the game in its current state, hell yes! mostly because i can't say no to playing the guitar in the midst of battle, it's worth a shot.</P>
